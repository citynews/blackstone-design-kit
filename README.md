# Blackstone Design Kit

The Blackstone Design Kit is a living document that contains all of our visual assets (components, iconography, color palettes, grids, templates, responsive behavior, etc). This document evolves and changes as the product evolves.


## :mag: Accessibility

(Note: downloading from the main repo page will download the entire repo including previous version)

* The Design Kit requires having the latest version of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> installed.
* Open the Design Kit file in Sketch
