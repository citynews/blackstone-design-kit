# Blackstone Design Kit

The Blackstone Design Kit is a living document that contains all of our visual assets (components, iconography, color palettes, grids, templates, responsive behavior, etc). This document evolves and changes as the product evolves.


## :mag: Accessibility
All of the designs within the Blackstone Design Kit meet the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines</a>. If you choose to customize these designs, please make sure they continue to meet these requirements.
